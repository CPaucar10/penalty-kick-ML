# Predicting Penalty Kicks with ML models

## Overview

This project was conducted as a component of my Independent Work Study, where, with the aid of the seminar professor, I used Data Science and Machine Learning models to be able to conduct data analysis and draw conclusions after training different types of models on the data. 


A complete report of this project is provided in the repository. However, a quick summary of the report will be provided below as a guide to my work.


## Repo Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- **no_power_penalty_kick_new_features.csv:** Contains a CSV file of the data that I used for the project.
- **penalty_kick_ml.pdf:** Contains a PDF of the Jupyter Python script.
- **penalty_kick_ml_slides.pdf:** Contains a PDF of the slides I used when I presented my presentation.
- **penalty_kick_ml_video.mp4:** Contains a video recording of my presentation.
- **penalty_kick_models.ipynb:** Contains the Jupyter notebook for the project.
- **written_final_report.pdf:** Contains the written report for the project.
