# Predicting Penalty Kicks with ML models

## Overview

This project was conducted as a component of my Independent Work Study, where, with the aid of the seminar professor, I used Data Science and Machine Learning models to be able to conduct data analysis and draw conclusions after training different types of models on the data. 


A complete report of this project is provided in the repository. However, a quick summary of the report will be provided below as a guide to my work.


## Repo Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- **cpaucarMLR.pdf:** Contains a PDF version of the assignment.
- **cpaucarMLR.Rmd:** Contains the assignment, including text and R code, as a file from RStudio.
- **cpaucarMLR.R:** Contains the assignment as an R script.


This assignment was done in collaboration with a partner where we each compared our answers. Feel free to read through for more details on the components.
