# Predicting Penalty Kicks with ML models

## Overview

This project was conducted as a component of my Independent Work Study, where, with the aid of the seminar professor, I used Data Science and Machine Learning models to be able to conduct data analysis and draw conclusions after training different types of models on the data. 


A complete report of this project is provided in the repository. However, a quick summary of the report will be provided below as a guide to my work.

## Repo Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- **no_power_penalty_kick_new_features.csv:** Contains a CSV file of the data that I used for the project.
- **penalty_kick_ml.pdf:** Contains a PDF of the Jupyter Python script.
- **penalty_kick_ml_slides.pdf:** Contains a PDF of the slides I used when I presented my presentation.
- **penalty_kick_ml_video.mp4:** Contains a video recording of my presentation.
- **penalty_kick_models.ipynb:** Contains the Jupyter notebook for the project.
- **written_final_report.pdf:** Contains the written report for the project.

## Abstract

This paper details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a football (soccer in the U.S) penalty predictor that can be used in a myriad amount of ways. This can include teaching goalkeepers whether a penalty will go in based on the penalty kicker’s foot and direction of the ball they shoot. Another way includes predicting penalty kicks for betting purposes, or simply trying to predict whether a penalty kick will go in live, putting features into a model and then comparing them to the user’s guess. This project uses various machine learning models such as decision trees and random forest, to be able to offer the user a simpler way of being able to predict whether a penalty kick will go in or not. This application of a predictor can be used to predict penalty kicks live during nationally televised penalty kick shootout and even be applied for betting purposes of the user.

## Datasets

The dataset that was used for my project was the **no_power_penalty_kick_new_features.csv** dataset, but this dataset was actually formed from a mixture of Kaggle Datasets and my own dataset. 

The datasets are as follows...
